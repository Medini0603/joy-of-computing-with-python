# first of all we need to download your
# facebook data, you need to login to your facebook account and then you need to go to 
# settings and download your facebook information there we need to store your
# information In an excel file that I have already explained then you need to import the
# pandas library it basically provide you easy to use data structure for data analysis then
# you need to import nltk library nltk library will help you to process the human
# language it will basically help you to analyse the human data it will help you in
# sentimental analysis of human data, sentiment analysis involves working out whether
# a piece of text is a positive negative or neutral I have already given you a example of
# a positive neutral and negative sentences then you will not be using only nltk will be
# using vader too vader also takes into account the intensity of the sentiment, yes then
# you need to download the vader lexicon, lexicon acts as a dictionary here, you also
# need to convert your excel sheet that you have created to a data frame, what is a data
# frame? Data frame is basically two dimensional structures in the form of table which
# # is provided by pandaâ€™s library

# now convert our data to dataframes for easy analysis using panda library 
# xl = pd.read_csv(file)
