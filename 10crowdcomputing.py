# from multiprocessing.sharedctypes import Value


# crowd computing

# here crowd estimates the solution to given problem 
# and median of their estimation gives the right answer

# how
# some overestimates the Value
# some underestimate the Value
# hence median gives the right answer
#mean and median etc must me found in diff expt diff values give correct ans

# overestimation-underestimation=0
